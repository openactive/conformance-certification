# OpenActive Conformance Certification Vocabulary Terms

This is the specification for the JSON-LD namespace used by the OpenActive Conformance Certificates generated by the [OpenActive Test Suite](https://github.com/openactive/openactive-test-suite).

> Status: Draft | [Please Provide Feedback via GitHub](https://github.com/openactive/conformance-certification/issues)

## Status

This specification and namespace is in a draft state, and currently intended only for implementation within certificates generated by the [OpenActive Test Suite](https://github.com/openactive/openactive-test-suite), and by the associated [OpenActive Certificate Validation Service](https://github.com/openactive/openactive-test-suite/tree/master/packages/openactive-integration-tests/test/certification).

## Overview

This vocabulary is used to render machine-readable JSON-LD within an OpenActive Conformance Certificate. A full discussion of the rationale behind this approach can be found in the [initial proposal](https://github.com/openactive/conformance-certification/issues/1).

## Namespace

The namespace MUST be referenced using the URL `"https://openactive.io/conformance-certification"` (which will return the [JSON-LD definition](https://openactive.io/conformance-certification/conformance-certification.jsonld) if the `Accept` header contains `application/ld+json`), and is designed to be used in conjunction with the `"https://openactive.io/"` namespace.
